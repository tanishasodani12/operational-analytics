# Operational Analytics & User Engagement Study (SQL)

This project focuses on analyzing user engagement trends, job review activity, device usage patterns, and workflow efficiency using SQL queries. The goal was to identify performance bottlenecks and provide insights that can support decision-making in improving user engagement and operational throughput.

---

## 🎯 Goal of the Project
To analyze operational and engagement metrics across job reviews, user activity, device usage, and email interactions to identify trends and improvement opportunities.

---

## 🗂️ Dataset Used
The project was built using the following relational tables:

| Table Name      | Description |
|-----------------|-------------|
| `job_data`      | Contains job review timestamps and submission activity |
| `users`         | Stores user profile and account creation dates |
| `events`        | Logs weekly activity across different device platforms |
| `email_events`  | Tracks email opens & clicks for engagement analysis |

---

## ✅ What I Did
- Wrote **15+ SQL queries** across **9 tasks** in MySQL Workbench.
- Calculated **weekly active users**, user retention trends, and growth.
- Measured **job review frequency**, finding **only 3 active review days in November**.
- Built **7-day rolling average throughput** to understand workflow consistency.
- Analyzed **language share distribution**, identifying **Persian at 37.5%**.
- Examined **device usage**, showing **mobile as the most dominant platform**.
- Compared **email opens vs. clicks** to identify marketing improvement gaps.

## 🛠️ Tools Used
| Category | Tools / Skills |
|---------|----------------|
| Database | **MySQL Workbench** |
| Querying | **SQL (Joins, CTEs, Aggregations, Group By, Window Functions)** |
| Presentation | **PowerPoint for insight reporting** |

---

## 📊 Results (With Measured Insights)
| Insight Identified | Measurement / Outcome |
|-------------------|----------------------|
| Job review activity was low | **Only 3 days** of active job review engagement |
| Language usage distribution | **Persian dominated at ~37.5%** usage share |
| Device engagement trend | **Mobile devices had the highest weekly active usage** |
| User growth pattern | Steady **growth pattern month-over-month** |
| Email engagement performance | Click-through rate lower than open rate → improvement opportunity |
