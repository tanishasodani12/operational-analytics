## ✅ What I Did
- Wrote **15+ SQL queries** across **9 tasks** in MySQL Workbench.
- Calculated **weekly active users**, user retention trends, and growth.
- Measured **job review frequency**, finding **only 3 active review days in November**.
- Built **7-day rolling average throughput** to understand workflow consistency.
- Analyzed **language share distribution**, identifying **Persian at 37.5%**.
- Examined **device usage**, showing **mobile as the most dominant platform**.
- Compared **email opens vs. clicks** to identify marketing improvement gaps.
